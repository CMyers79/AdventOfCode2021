# AdventOfCode2021
I'm a junior level CS student, so these solutions are not competetive; I just want to see if I could solve all the problems.  
The space complexity problems were challenging because I haven't studied how to optimize for that yet.
It was also my first time implementing Dijkstra's.
This was fun, highly recommend!
